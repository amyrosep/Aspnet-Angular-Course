This is a partially finished web application from a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/) on Asp.net Core and Angular. It is a really solid course that I enjoyed working through. In particular I enjoyed learning Angular, which felt more intuitive for me than React. I got about two thirds through this course, derailed by the time demands of being a parent.
